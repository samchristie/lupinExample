  <p>This application was built to demonstrate web application development using:
  	<ul>
  	  <li>Riot - an lightweight MVVM framework with custom tag support</li>
  	  <li>Lupin - a lightweight flask-like toolkit for event and state management</li>
  	  <li>Immutable - a library for tracking changes in application state</li>
  	</ul>
  </p>
  <p>The application uses local browser storage to avoid incorporation of a proper database subsystem or REST back end. It is built in ES6 and translated using babel. It is packed into a single javaScript bundle with webpack.</p>
